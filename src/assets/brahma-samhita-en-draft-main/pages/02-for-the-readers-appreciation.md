All Glory to Śrī Kṛṣṇa Chaitanya\
the Golden Moon of Śrī Mayapur

## For the Reader's Appreciation

In the *Madhya-līlā*, ninth chapter of *Śrī Chaitanya-charitāmṛta*, we find:

"That day, the Lord went to the bank of the Payasvinī River. After bathing He went to the Ādi-Keśava Temple where He met with the great devotees there, and it was there that He obtained the ancient manuscript of the fifth chapter of *Śrī Brahma-saṁhitā*. This gave the Lord unlimited joy, and divine ecstatic symptoms appeared in His Body—trembling, weeping, perspiring; He was stunned, thrilled with ecstasy.

"As a scripture embodying perfect truths (siddhānta), *Śrī Brahma-saṁhitā* has no equal; it is the best of all holy books proclaiming the glories of the Supreme Lord Govinda. Endless perfect truths are expressed in few words. It is the essence of all Vaiṣṇava scriptures.

"The Lord had that manuscript copied very carefully. Then He joyfully went to visit the temple of Ananta-Padmanābha."

What more can I say than this? At least I may say that if this scripture is reckoned as one of the most ancient scriptures, then it is an unprecedented and truly authoritative source of the teachings of Kṛṣṇa-bhakti, devotion for the Supreme Lord, Kṛṣṇa. Again, if it is suggested that this scripture was not originally found in this province (Bengal), so it was actually authored by Śrī Śrī Mahāprabhu, what could be more happy for us? By obtaining any work of siddhānta written by Śrī Mahāprabhu, no trace of doubt can ever remain in the world of Vaiṣṇava thought. However one may consider it, this holy book, *Śrī Brahma-saṁhitā*, is worshippable to every devotee.
