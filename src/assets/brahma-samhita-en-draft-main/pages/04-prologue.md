All Glory to the Divine Master\
and the Supreme Lord Śrī Kṛṣṇa Chaitanya

## Prologue

Ever since the day that I, by the causeless grace of the all-auspicious descent of the Supreme Lord in the forms of Śrī Śrī Nitāi-Chaitanyadev, attained the shelter of the lotus feet of my most worshippable Śrīla Guru Mahārāj Oṁ Viṣṇupād Paramahaṁsa Śrī Śrīmad Bhakti Rakṣak Śrīdhar Dev-Goswāmī Mahārāj, by his boundless mercy the inspiration for the genuine search for the ultimate truth was awakened in my heart; and further, that causelessly gracious Śrīla Guru Mahārāj gave me that initial connection, the vital link that enables us to attain the qualification to enter into the basic land of faith (ādau śraddhā) in accordance with Śrī Śrīmat Rūpa Goswāmī's guiding verse for the progressive life of divine service (bhajan): *ādau śraddhā tataḥ sādhu-saṅgaḥ*. From that very time, I, by his grace, got the fortune of having this message of *Gītopaniṣad* take its tangible shape in my heart: *tad viddhi praṇipātena paripraśnena sevayā, upadekṣyanti te jñānaṁ jñāninas tattva-darśinaḥ*—"Satisfy the enlightened Guru with your prostrate obeisances, reasonable enquiries and sincere service, and you will be able to realize the knowledge I have spoken of. The great souls who are adept in the scriptures and endowed with direct experience concerning the supreme spirit, *Param Brahman*, will teach you." Similarly, it is also mentioned in the Upaniṣads: *tad vijñānārthaṁ sa gurum evābhigachchhet samit pāṇiḥ śrotriyaṁ Brahma-niṣṭham*—"To attain specific (devotional) knowledge of the Supreme Lord, one aspiring for auspiciousness must bring offerings, and approach, by his thought, word and deed, a genuine guru who is versed in the purport of the Vedas and who knows the reality of Kṛṣṇa."

Whether in the divine world or in the ordinary world, in order to properly learn whatever subject we wish, we must take the shelter of a specialist—a genuine teacher. Actually, there is no way to achieve divine knowledge without the grace of the genuine Divine Master, and that knowledge will manifest according to the degree of one's surrender.

The primeval poet, four-headed Lord Brahmā who was born from the universal lotus flower, is the original Guru of our divine succession. So this divine succession stemming from Lord Brahmā is naturally illuminated by the divine light of his perception, his worship and his revelation. In the beginning, by the grace of the Supreme Lord, through the agency of His divine sound vibration (Divyā Saraswatī), Lord Brahmā was taught the eighteen-syllabled Śrī Kṛṣṇa-mantra and he practised penances in pursuance of cultivating that mantra. He propitiated his Worshippable Object by his perfect meditation, and he was raised to the twice-born status by being initiated and purified by the Lord's divine flute song emanating (*muralīṣṭa-kīrtana-dhanaṁ*) as the Kāma-gāyatrī mantra. He was thus initiated by the original Guru of gurus who is like a vast rolling ocean of the waves of divine Pastimes—the matchless reality in Person—the Supreme Lord Śrī Kṛṣṇa. In other words, by the potency of that function he attained to his second birth—the divine realm was completely unveiled before him.

Śrīla Bhakti Vinod Ṭhākur has written, "Kāma-gāyatrī ... is the gāyatrī taken after the eighteen-syllabled mantra ... In this gāyatrī is indicated the realization of the līlā or divine Pastimes of Śrī Gopījana-vallabha, the beloved of the gopīs, after complete meditation upon Him; and the prayer to attain to (the service of) that transcendental Cupid. In the entire transcendental world there is no higher pursuit for divine love in the shelter of an ecstatic relationship with Him."

Empowered by faithfully meditating upon and singing that gāyatrī, Lord Brahmā freely wandered throughout the length and breadth of the ocean of truth; and his prayers in glorification of Śrī Govinda, which are the quintessence of all the Vedas, are the basis of the fifth of the hundred chapters of *Śrī Brahma-saṁhitā*. Moreover, the fortunate, faithful virtuous souls can enter into a crystal-clear conception of the entire mundane world's and transcendental world's manifestation, existence and flow, by reading or singing this hymn with due regard and devotion.

The supremely magnanimous source of all Avatārs, the bestower of shelter in the shade of the umbrella of His Own perfect philosophy (siddhānta) of inconceivable oneness and distinction (achintya-bhedābheda)—the Supreme Lord Śrī Chaitanyadev—was filled with divine ecstasy upon observing the perfect reflection of the light of the perfect philosophy revealed by the fifth chapter of *Śrī Brahma-saṁhitā* rich with the songs of the glories of Śrī Śrīla Govindadev, the tips of the toes of whose Lotus Feet are eternally illuminated by the ārati or worship offered by the radiance of the crown-jewels of all the Vedas. With great love, He brought in His Own hand the manuscript of the book from South India and joyfully offered it to the hands of the devotees. In the words of Śrīla Kṛṣṇadās Kavirāj we find:

    siddhānta-śāstra nāhi 'brahma-saṁhitā'-samāna,
    govinda-mahimā-jñānera parama kāraṇa,
    alpa akṣare kahe siddhānta apāra,
    sakala-vaiṣṇava-śāstra-madhye ati sāra.

"As a scripture embodying perfect truths, *Śrī Brahma-saṁhitā* has no equal; it is the supreme wisdom of the glories of the Supreme Lord Govinda. Endless perfect truths are expressed in few words. It is the quintessence of all Vaiṣṇava scriptures."

I feel the need to mention just one more important point, regarding our reading *Śrīmad Bhāgavatam* as Śrīman Mahāprabhu has had it made known to us: *yāha Bhāgavata paḍa Vaiṣṇavera sthāne*—"Go and learn the *Bhāgavat* from a Vaiṣṇava." Taking the gist of this instruction to heart, it is definitely everyone's duty to give careful attention to their supreme benefit by singing and preaching this king of holy books, faithfully following the path chalked out by Śrīla Sachchid-ānanda Bhakti Vinod Ṭhākur; because faithfully following the commentary of that great King of Āchāryas, the guardian of the Śrī Brahma-Mādhva-Gauḍīya sampradāya, Śrīla Śrī Jīva Goswāmī—Śrīla Bhakti Vinod Ṭhākur has brought ever-increasing joy to the hearts of the true devotees by illuminating the Lotus Feet of sach-chid-ānanda-vigraha Śrī Govinda, the embodiment of truth, consciousness and joy, in the tender lotus flower of perfect truths that has been brought to bloom in his personal divine revelations. This is the unique, safe refuge for the sincere seekers and also the exclusive Sāraswata-Gauḍīya-Vaiṣṇavas who are already conversant with the art of divine service.

By the grace of our Grand Guru, the embodiment of Śrī Gaura's grace—Oṁ Viṣṇupād Śrīmad Bhakti Siddhānta Saraswatī Goswāmī Prabhupād—and his personal associates, we now find that fortunate souls the world over have become intoxicated with Śrī Gaura-saṅkīrtan. In this way singing and singing the glories of Śrī Gaurahari, floating and floating down the ocean of joy of the Hare Kṛṣṇa mahāmantra taught by Him, they are progressing towards the divine abode of transcendental touchstone in their divine aspirations for loving service unto the Divine Couple Śrī Śrī Rādhā-Govinda, who are ever attended by the loving service of hundreds of thousands of Lakṣmīs. This jewel of holy books, as the elixir of life of all such blessed souls, will fortify them more and more. With this faith we are attempting to bring this book to light in the international English language. If I may quote Śrīla Prabhupāda's words, *abhakta prayāsa, dekhiyā nā hāsa, ihā guru-gaura-dāsya*—"Don't laugh to see this nondevotee's attempt, for he's trying to serve Guru and Mahāprabhu." With the aim of fulfilling the heart's desires of our supremely worshippable Śrīla Guru Mahārāj, today we are overjoyed because this greatly aspired-for service attempt has borne fruits by the mercy of the Vaiṣṇavas who are transcendental wish- fulfilling trees incarnate.

Needless to say, the painstaking work of translation, etc., of this great treatise can be appreciated by the learned. Still, our dear and close friend, to whom Śrīla Guru Mahārāj was so affectionate, and who has been given the responsibility of continuing and expanding our Śrī Maṭh's work in the Western countries, the well-known and qualified preacher Tridaṇḍi Swāmī Śrīpād Bhakti Ānanda Sāgar Mahārāj has, by his sincere serving efforts, day and night, fulfilled the task. For the basis of the translation he has felt himself fortunate to have been able to consult our Grand Gurudev Jagad-Guru Prabhupād Śrīla Bhakti Siddhānta Saraswatī Goswāmī Ṭhākur's Madras Gauḍīya Maṭh and Mayapur Śrī Chaitanya Maṭh's English and Bengali editions respectively. He not only rendered the translation, but he accepted the entire responsibility of bringing the publication to light, and he has spared no pains in bringing it out in a beautiful and faultless form. Still, our unsuspecting errors, omissions, etc., may occur, as the essence-drinking, liberal Vaiṣṇavas and the devoted readers are not unaware of, yet we have full confidence that they never suffer any dearth of benevolence in their natural forbearance. In conclusion, in the words of Śrīla Guru Mahārāj I would beg to offer my obeisances unto the lotus feet of them all.

    granthārthaṁ jaḍa-dhī-hṛdi tv iha mahotsāhādi-sañchāraṇair
    yeṣāñ chātra satāṁ satīrtha-suhṛdām saṁśodhanādyaiś vā
    yeṣāñ chāpy adhame kṛpā mayi śubhā pāṭhādibhir vānyathā
    sarveṣām aham atra pāda-kamalaṁ vande punar vai punaḥ

"Those dear godbrothers and true devotees who by bringing out this book have given much life to my poor heart, or who have assisted in its refinement, or who may read it, or who have in any other way bestowed or may in the future bestow their auspicious goodwill upon this humble soul—I now offer my humble obeisances unto the lotus feet of them all."
