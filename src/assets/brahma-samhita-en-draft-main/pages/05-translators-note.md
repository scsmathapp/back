All Glory to the Divine Master\
and the Supreme Lord Śrī Kṛṣṇa Chaitanya

## Translator's Note

I offer my humble obeisances unto the lotus feet of my Dīkṣā-guru Oṁ Viṣṇupād Śrī Śrīla Bhaktivedānta Swāmī Mahārāj, unto the lotus feet of my Param Śikṣā-guru Oṁ Viṣṇupād Śrī Śrīla Bhakti Rakṣak Śrīdhar Dev-Goswāmī Mahārāj, and unto the lotus feet of my Śikṣā-guru Oṁ Viṣṇupād Śrī Śrīla Bhakti Sundar Govinda Mahārāj, Śrīla Śrīdhar Mahārāj's most beloved intimate servitor and disciple, and his personally appointed guardian-servitor and President-Āchārya for Śrī Chaitanya Sāraswat Maṭh, Nabadwip, India, with its centres internationally.

By their grace, and by the grace of the unalloyed devotees in their line, I was given the service of rendering into English this holy book *Śrī Brahma-saṁhitā* from the Bengali translation and elaborate commentary of the most venerable Oṁ Viṣṇupāda Śrī Śrīla Sachchid-ānanda Bhakti Vinod Ṭhākur \[1838-1914\], the great preacher of unalloyed devotion in this most exalted divine succession of Śrī Chaitanya Mahāprabhu. The work was first published in 1897, and also edited by our Param Gurudev Prabhupād Śrīla Bhakti Siddhānta Saraswatī Goswāmī Ṭhākur. We are eternally indebted to those great guides and reformers who made spiritual history by illuminating the world by restating Śrīman Mahāprabhu's teachings in their pure form in their vast literary contributions, their words and their deeds. When will that day be mine when this lowly soul can render some service to the dust of their holy lotus feet?

The divine teachings of *Śrī Brahma-saṁhitā* can be at times intricate in their English rendering, especially for those who have had little or no previous acquaintance with the subject, so I have tried my utmost to portray the original concepts as simply and concisely as possible, inserting footnotes, etc., at relevant points to assist the readers.

I am ever indebted to all the kind devotees around the world for their valuable assistance and encouragement in consultation, editing and proofing. And I am bound by unceasing gratitude to my dear Godbrother Śrī Ananta Kṛṣṇa Prabhu, director of Édesvíz Kiadó, Budapest, Hungary, who bore the entire cost of bringing out this most important publication.

Above all, Śrīla Govinda Mahārāj, by his divine affection and brilliant example of divine service to Śrīla Guru Mahārāj, is our eternal source of strength and inspiration. In offering this effort to the lotus hand of Oṁ Viṣṇupād Śrīla Govinda Mahārāj, I pray that His Divine Grace and the great souls of the Guru-varga and the pure devotees of the Lord may be satisfied, thus drawing the grace of the Supreme Lord Śrī Kṛṣṇa Chaitanya.
