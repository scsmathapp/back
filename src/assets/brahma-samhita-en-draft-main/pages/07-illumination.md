**Oṁ Viṣṇupād Śrīla Sachchidānanda Bhakti Vinod Ṭhākur**

*\[His preface to his Bengali translation and commentary\]*

Lord Brahmā meticulously collected (compiled) this gem, *Śrī Brahma-saṁhitā*, which is a vast mine of perfect conclusions or siddhānta; thus did Brahmā sing the unending glories of Śrī Kṛṣṇa. These holy prayers are entered into the fifth chapter of the book. They are the supreme wealth of humanity. On His travels throughout South India, Śrī Gaurāṅga, the ocean of grace and supreme friend of the souls blinded in the darkness of this age of Kali, retrieved this divine treasure of *Brahma-saṁhitā* just to deliver the souls surrendered unto Him. The Sanskrit commentary of this work flowed from the pen of Śrī Jīva Goswāmī Prabhu, who is acclaimed by the pious intelligentsia as the greatest philosopher the world has ever known. His commentary was evolved through deep study of the monumental archives of the established Vedic scriptures. In his benevolence, the venerable Śrī Jīva gave this gift to the Gauḍīya Vaiṣṇavas.

Once my Divine Master, Śrī Bipin Bihārī Prabhu, instructed me to write, expanding on that commentary of Śrī Jīva Goswāmī Prabhu. So it is with a joyful heart that this humble servitor has presented a few words herein. If the devotees reflect on these writings with the pure theistic intellect of distinguishing mundanity from transcendence[^2] the heart's desire of this servitor will be fulfilled, because pure devotion will be preached in the world.

O Śrī Rūpa, Śrī Jīva, Śrī Sanātan—thy grace is like an ocean; you are life and soul for the devotees. The purport of the commentary is deep and unfathomable like the ocean, at the edge of which I stand benumbed. You must graciously ordain that the divine potency enter my words.

Bringing to bloom with great care the beautiful flower-buds which are the words of Śrī Jīva, and offering my prostrate obeisances unto the Divine Master and the Supreme Lord Śrī Kṛṣṇachandra, I shall know myself to be blessed when I can offer these flowers to the hand of the pure devotee. Such is my heart's aspiration.

[^2]: Those who, by the potency of bhakti, have attained the strength to differentiate between the transcendent and the mundane are alone qualified to enter into the mysteries of this *Prakāśinī Gauḍīya* Commentary.
