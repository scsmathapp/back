## Verse 4

    tat-kiñjalkaṁ tad-aṁśānāṁ tat-patrāṇi śriyām api

### Translation

The core of that eternal holy abode which is called Gokula is the hexagonal land of Kṛṣṇa's abode. The stamens or petals are the residences of the cowherds or gopas, who are Kṛṣṇa's own, His dearmost friends and high loving devotees that are a part of His Own Self. Those abodes appear like many walls, all beautifully effulgent. The extensive foliage of that lotus constitutes the subforests that are the abodes of the loving damsels of Kṛṣṇa, headed by Śrī Rādhikā.

### Purport

The transcendental Gokula is in the form of a lotus flower. Its core is hexagonal; in the centre is the predominated and predominating moiety, Śrī Rādhā-Kṛṣṇa, who are the objective of the eighteen-syllable mantra. Their various subjective personal expansions (intimate serving associates) of intrinsic divine potency surround Them. The seed is Rādhā-Kṛṣṇa.

The *Gopāla-tāpanīyopaniṣad* states, *tasmād oṁkāra-sambhūto gopālo viśvasambhavaḥ, klīm oṁkārasya chaikatvaṁ paṭhyate brahma-vādibhiḥ. Oṁkāra* means Gopāl, who is both the potency and the potent, and *klīṁ* means Oṁkāra. Therefore, klīṁ or the primary desire-seed (kāma-bīja) expresses the transcendental reality of Śrī Śrī Rādhā and Kṛṣṇa.
