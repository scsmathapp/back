## Verse 6

    evaṁ jyotirmayo devaḥ sadānandaḥ parātparaḥ
    ātmārāmasya tasyāsti prakṛtyā na samāgamaḥ

### Translation

That Lord of Gokula is the transcendental Supreme Personality of Godhead—the Own Self of eternal ecstasy. He is beyond the purview of mundanity, and He ever enjoys in the all-conscious spiritual realm; He is never associated with the beguiling mundane nature.

### Purport

Kṛṣṇa's exclusive divine potency, His Own personified potency, has manifest the Pastimes of Goloka or Gokula. By Her grace, the jīvas, who are of the marginal potency, may also enter into those Pastimes. The secondary external Māyā potency, who is like the shadow of that divine (chit) potency, is situated on the far (lower) shore of the Virajā River, which is at the lower limit of the Brahman plane; and the Brahman is situated at the lowest boundary of Mahā-Vaikuṇṭha, which is the surrounding locality or outskirts of Goloka. In the face of such infinite purity, the external Māyā potency feels ashamed to appear in Kṛṣṇa's view, to say nothing of taking His association.
