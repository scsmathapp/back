## Verse 7

    māyayā 'ramamāṇasya na viyogas tayā saha
    ātmanā ramayā reme tyakta-kālaṁ sisṛkṣayā

### Translation

Kṛṣṇa is the indifferent predominator of the external deluding nature, Māyā: He does not consort with external Māyā. Yet Māyā is not wholly separate or divorced from the Supreme Absolute Truth that is Kṛṣṇa. In His will to create the world, He unites with His own transcendental potency, Ramā; and His enjoyment in the form of casting His glance, which is the dispatching of His potency of time, is purely indirect.

### Purport

Kṛṣṇa does not directly associate with the Māyā potency; His relationship with her is only an indirect hint of association; He glances at the Māyā potency through the agency of (in the form of) His predominative descent or Puruṣ-avatār, Kāraṇārṇavaśāyī Viṣṇu (Mahā-Viṣṇu), who reclines on the causal ocean; Kāraṇārṇavaśāyī Viṣṇu is a plenary portion of Mahāsaṅkarṣaṇ of Vaikuṇṭha, and Vaikuṇṭha is the plenary abode of Kṛṣṇa.

Nor does the Lord associate with Māyā even by that act of glancing, since the divine potency, Ramā, as His unfailingly loyal potency, carries the function of His glancing. The external Māyā, as a maidservant of Ramā, engages in the service of the Lord's plenary portion united with Ramā, and the current of time is the supernatural power of Ramā that accomplishes the work, and thus, the predominant influence in the universal creative power.
