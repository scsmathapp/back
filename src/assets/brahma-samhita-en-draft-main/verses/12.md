## Verse 12

    nārāyaṇaḥ sa bhagavān āpas tasmāt sanātanāt
    āvir āsīt kāraṇārṇo-nidhiḥ saṅkarṣaṇātmakaḥ
    yoga-nidrāṁ gatas tasmin sahasrāṁśaḥ svayaṁ mahān

### Translation

Mahā-Viṣṇu is known as 'Nārāyaṇ' in the mundane world. From this eternal Personality the water of the Causal Ocean is born. A plenary portion of Saṅkarṣaṇ of the Paravyoma, with thousands upon thousands of plenary expansions, He is the Supreme Personality of Godhead, the Supreme Male; for His divine sleep (yoga-nidrā) He reclines upon those waters of the Causal Ocean.

### Purport

The Supreme Lord's ecstatic trance in the intrinsic joy of His Own Self is called yoga-nidrā. Ramā Devī, mentioned previously, is Herself yoga-nidrā personified as Yogamāyā, the divine potency of the Lord.
