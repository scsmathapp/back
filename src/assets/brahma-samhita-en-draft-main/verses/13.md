## Verse 13

    tad-roma-bila-jāleṣu bījaṁ saṅkarṣanasya cha
    haimāny-aṇḍāni jātāni mahābhūtāvṛtāni tu

### Translation

The divine seeds of Saṅkarṣaṇ are born from the pores of Mahā-Viṣṇu as infinite golden egg-cells; those golden cells are covered by the five predominant material elements.

### Purport

Such is the colossal magnitude of the function of the primal Avatār Personality who reclines on the waters of the Causal Ocean. Infinite billions of 'seeds', each a universe, are produced from the cavities of His bodily pores. Those universes are copies of the infinite abode of the spiritual world; as long as they remain within the body of the Puruṣ-avatār, they are, as a lower or hazy aspect of divinity (chidābhāsa), something like golden eggs; but when Mahā-Viṣṇu decides to bring about the creation of this world, the subtle existence of the predominant material elements—which participates as a factor of the māyik instrumental and efficient causes—envelops them. Those golden 'cosmic eggs' emanate with the exhalation of the Supreme Personality, and when they enter into the unlimited womb-chamber of Māyā they are augmented by the unamalgamated five mundane elements (earth, water, fire, air and ether).
