## Verse 14

    praty-aṇḍam evam ekāṁśād ekāṁśād viśati svayam
    sahasra-mūrdhā viśvātmā mahāviṣṇuḥ sanātanaḥ

### Translation

That Mahā-Viṣṇu enters into each and every universe (or cosmic egg) in His individual plenary portions. All those divine portions are His supramundane almighty form—the eternal form of Mahā-Viṣṇu with thousands upon thousands of heads—the Soul of the universe.

### Purport

Mahā-Viṣṇu reclining on the causal ocean is the plenary portion of Mahāsaṅkarṣaṇ; as many universes emanate from Him, He enters into every one of them as His personal portions. Every one of those portions is the Garbhodakaśāyī Puruṣa, who is in all respects similar to Mahā-Viṣṇu. Garbhodakaśāyī Viṣṇu is known as the aggregate Antaryāmī or the collective, omnipresent Supersoul of the universes.
