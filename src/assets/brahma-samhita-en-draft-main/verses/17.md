## Verse 17

    atha tais trividhair veśair līlām udvahataḥ kila
    yoga-nidrā bhagavatī tasya śrīr iva saṅgatā

### Translation

Thereafter, that Supreme Personality of Godhead, having entered the universe in the guises of Viṣṇu, Brahmā and Śambhu, enacts His Pastimes of sustenance, creation and annihilation. These pastimes pertain to the mundane world; thus, since they are of a lower order, the Lord remains aloof, consorting with His Yoga-nidrā who is an aspect of His divine potency in His inherent existence as Viṣṇu. She is the female embodiment of His trance of intrinsic divine ecstasy.

### Purport

As separated parts (vibhinnāṁśa) of the entity of the Lord, both Prajāpati and Śambhu are within the purview of separate egoism and thus each consort with their own alternate potencies in the forms of Sāvitrī and Umā. Only Bhagavān, the Supreme Personality of Godhead Viṣṇu, is the Lord of the divine or chit-potency personified in the form of Ramā or Śrī.
