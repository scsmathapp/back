## Verse 18

    sisṛkṣāyāṁ tato nābhes tasya padmaṁ viniryayau
    tan-nālaṁ hema-nalinaṁ brahmaṇo lokam adbhutam

### Translation

When Garbhodakaśāyī Viṣṇu desires to create the universe, a golden lotus flower appears from His navel. Situated on a stem, that lotus is Brahmaloka or Satyaloka, the abode of Lord Brahmā.

### Purport

Here the word 'gold' refers to chidābhāsa—the hazy aspect or reflection of divinity.
