## Verse 20

    yojayitvā tu tāny eva praviveśa svayaṁ guhām
    guhāṁ praviṣṭe tasmiṁs tu jīvātmā pratibudhyate

### Translation

Amalgamating all those disjointed elements, He manifested endless mundane universes and personally entered into the *guhā*, that is, He entered the inner region of the aggregate of universal forms. At that time, the jīvas who slept at the cataclysm were awakened.

### Purport

The word *guhā* has been given many interpretations in the scriptures. In certain places the unmanifest Pastimes of the Lord have been referred to as guhā, and elsewhere the place of location of the individual Supersoul of each universe has been referred to as guhā; also in many places, the innermost recess of each jīva's heart has been called guhā. The basic point is that any place that is unrevealed to the general observer is known as guhā.

In the previous millennium, all the jīvas that were merged in the body of the Supreme Lord Hari during the great universal devastation that occurred at the end of Lord Brahmā's lifetime were again manifest in the world in positions according to the impulses of their previous worldly actions or karma (*jīvātmā pratibudhyate*).
