## Verse 22

    evaṁ sarvātma-sambandhaṁ nābhyām padmaṁ harer abhūt
    tatra brahmābhavad bhuyaś chaturvedī chaturmukhaḥ

### Translation

The lotus that appears from the navel of Viṣṇu is linked in the relativity of all souls. Four-headed Brahmā, the knower of the four Vedas, takes his birth within that lotus.

### Purport

That lotus, which is the residence of the aggregate jīvas, appears from the puruṣa omnipresent within the universal forms. The personification of worldly pleasure, four-headed Brahmā, is born from the original Brahmā, Hiraṇyagarbha, who represents the aggregate jīvas in conditioned bodily existence. Thus, the position of Lord Brahmā is elucidated: as a god of delegated power, he similarly has the property of being a part of Kṛṣṇa as a separated portion (vibhinnāṁśa).
