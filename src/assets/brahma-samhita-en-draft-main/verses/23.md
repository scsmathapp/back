## Verse 23

    sañjāto bhagavach-chhaktyā tat-kālaṁ kila choditaḥ
    sisṛkṣāyāṁ matiṁ chakre pūrva-saṁskāra-saṁskṛtam
    dadarśa kevalaṁ dhvāntaṁ nānyat kim api sarvataḥ

### Translation

Upon his birth, Lord Brahmā, directed by the potency of the Supreme Lord, contemplated the matter of creation according to the tendencies shaped by his previous lives (pūrva saṁskāra); but he could see nothing but darkness in all directions.

### Purport

Lord Brahmā's attempt to create is only the result of impulses shaped by his previous situations. Every jīva accrues a nature and personality according to such a process, and by dint of that nature the jīva's attempts take shape. This is known as the 'unseen' or the 'fruit of action' (karma-phala). Lord Brahmā's natural impulse ensues by dint of his deeds in the previous age. In the same way, certain eligible jīvas also attain to the post of Brahmā.
