## Verse 24

    uvācha puratas tasmai tasya divyā sarasvatī
    kāma-kṛṣṇāya govinda-ṅe gopījana ity api
    vallabhāya priyā vahner mantraṁ te dāsyati priyam

### Translation

Then the divine vibration of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Divyā Saraswatī, said to Brahmā as he was seeing darkness all around, "O Brahman, *klīṁ kṛṣṇāya govindāya gopījana-vallabhāya svāhā*—this Mantra will bring about the fulfillment of all your cherished desires."

### Purport

The mantra of eighteen syllables including the seed of aspiration (klīṁ) is supreme. It has two attributes, one of which is to impel the pure soul towards the Supreme Charmer of the heart, Kṛṣṇa—the Lord of Gokula, the Lord of the gopīs. This is the acme of the soul's divine pursuit. When the devotee practitioner becomes free from selfish desire, he can attain to the perfection of divine love, prema, in this way. Yet in the case of the practitioner who harbours some personal desires, this supreme mantra fulfills those desires too. In the divine concept, the seed of aspiration is intrinsic within the lotus of Goloka; and the seed of desire reflected in material objects fulfills all kinds of desires in the māyik world.
