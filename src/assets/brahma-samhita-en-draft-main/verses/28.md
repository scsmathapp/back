## Verse 28

    trayā prabuddha 'tha vidhir vijñāta-tattva-sāgaraḥ
    tuṣṭāva veda-sāreṇa stotreṇānena keśavam

### Translation

Becoming enlightened by meditating upon that threefold gāyatrī, Brahmā became acquainted with the ocean of truth. Then he worshipped Śrī Kṛṣṇa, singing His transcendental glories by this hymn, which is the quintessence of all the Vedas.

### Purport

By meditating upon the Kāma-gāyatrī, Brahmā began to conceive, 'I am an eternal maidservant of Kṛṣṇa'. Although the profound mysteries of servitorship as a maidservant of Śrī Kṛṣṇa were not necessarily revealed to him, his discrimination between spirit and matter developed to such a degree that an ocean of truth came within his grasp. When all the expressions of the Vedas thus became manifest within him, he sung this hymn, which expresses the quintessence of all the Vedas. Because in all respects this hymn is replete with the Vaiṣṇava-siddhānta (perfect conclusions or truths of Vaiṣṇavism), Śrī Chaitanya Mahāprabhu has taught it to His personally favoured devotees.

The good readers may take the opportunity to daily sing and relish this hymn with devotion.
