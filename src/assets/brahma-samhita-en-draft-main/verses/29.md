## Verse 29

    chintāmaṇi-prakarasadmasu kalpavṛkṣa-
    lakṣāvṛteṣu surabhīr abhipālayantam
    lakṣmī-sahasra-śata-saṁbhrama-sevyamānaṁ
    govindam ādi puruṣaṁ tam ahaṁ bhajāmi

### Translation

    Surrounded by millions of wish-fulfilling trees,
        in abodes made of multitudes of wish-yielding gems,
    He who tends the ever-yielding cows
        and who is perpetually served with great affection
    by hundreds of thousands of Lakṣmīs—
        the Primeval Lord, Govinda, do I worship.

### Purport

Here, by the word *chintāmaṇi*, 'transcendental gem' is to be understood. As the potency of Māyā forms the mundane world from five basic material elements, the divine potency has fashioned the transcendental world from the transcendental element of chintāmaṇi. There, the element of chintāmaṇi that serves as the structural material of the residence of the Supreme Lord is infinitely more rare and charming than the general chintāmaṇi known as a 'philosophers stone'. The general wish-fulfilling tree yields the fruits of dharma, artha, kāma and mokṣa, or religion, wealth, desire and liberation, whereas the wish-fulfilling trees in Kṛṣṇa's abode yield unending fruits of love divine in full variegatedness. The general kāma-dhenu or cows of plenty give milk as soon as they are milked, whereas from the udders of the cows of Goloka perpetually flows an ocean of the milk that is the fountain of love divine, showering transcendental ecstasy upon the pure devotee jīvas, dispelling all their hunger and thirst.

The words lakṣa-lakṣa and sahasra-śata or hundreds of thousands (of Lakṣmīs) indicate infinite multitudes; saṁbhrama (describing the Lakṣmīs' service to Kṛṣṇa) indicates 'with hearts saturated with love'; *lakṣmī* means 'beautiful cowherd damsels' or 'gopis'; and *ādi-puruṣa* means 'He who is the origin of all that be'.
