## Verse 31

    ālola-chandraka-lasad-vanamālya-vaṁśī-
    ratnāṅgadaṁ praṇayakelikalā-vilāsam
    śyāmaṁ tribhaṅgalalitaṁ niyata-prakāśaṁ
    govindam ādi puruṣaṁ tam ahaṁ bhajāmi

### Translation

    Around His neck is a garland of forest-flowers
        swinging to and fro,
    and adorned with a peacock feather locket;
        His flute held in hands
    adorned with jewelled bracelets,
        He who eternally revels in Pastimes of love,
    whose charming threefold curved form,
        Śyāmasundar, is His eternal feature—
    that Primeval Lord Govinda do I adore.

### Purport

The *chintāmaṇi-prakara* verse is description of the divine abode and the divine Names headed by Govinda; the *veṇuṁ kvaṇantam* verse is a description of the Lord's eternal divine form; and in this verse that form's divine amorous Pastimes embodied in sixty-four transcendental qualities are described. Whatever divine affairs can be described in the scope of divine consorthood, madhura-rasa, are found within these loving Pastimes.
