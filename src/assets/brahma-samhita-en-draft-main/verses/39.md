## Verse 39

    rāmādi-mūrtiṣu kalāniyamena tiṣṭhan
    nānāvatāram akarod bhuvaneṣu kiṁ tu
    kṛṣṇaḥ svayaṁ samabhavat paramaḥ pumān yo
    govindam ādi puruṣaṁ tam ahaṁ bhajāmi

### Translation

    The Lord has shown in the world many Avatārs
        such as Rāma, by expanding His plenary expansions
    and expansions of those expansions anon;
        and He, Kṛṣṇa, also came personally—
    that primeval Lord Govinda, do I worship. 

### Purport

His expanded descents or Avatārs as Rāma, etc., come down from Vaikuṇṭha; and Kṛṣṇa Himself, along with the Vraja Dhām of Goloka, graciously comes down to appear in this world. The deep purport herein is that Kṛṣṇa Chaitanya, One with the Supreme Lord Kṛṣṇa, also accepts His advent in that personal appearance.
