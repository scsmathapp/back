## Verse 40

    yasya prabhā prabhavato jagad-aṇḍa-koṭi-
    koṭiṣv aśeṣa-vasudhādi-vibhūti-bhinnam
    tad-brahma niṣkalam anantam aśeṣa-bhūtaṁ
    govindam ādi puruṣaṁ tam ahaṁ bhajāmi

### Translation

    I worship that primeval Lord Govinda.
        Because His power and effulgence is the source
    of that which is described in the Upaniṣads
        as the nondifferentiated Brahman,
    being distinct from the domain of
        millions of planets and planes like Earth, etc.,
    it appears as the indivisible, infinite, Absolute Truth.

[^1]

### Purport

The aggregate universes created by Māyā are as a quadrant of the majesty of Govinda (*ekapāda-vibhūti*); the nondifferentiated Brahman is a superior truth to that māyik quadrant. Brahman is an effulgence situated as the outer wall of the transcendental world which constitutes Govinda's triquadrantal majesty (tripāda-vibhūti). It is indivisible, that is, without expansion, therefore it appears, as stated (in the Upaniṣads), ekam evādvitīyam, as the one without a second. It is an element both infinite and undifferentiated.

[^1]: Vide purport of verse 34.
