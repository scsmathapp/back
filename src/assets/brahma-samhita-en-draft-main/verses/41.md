## Verse 41

    māyā hi yasya jagad-aṇḍa-śatāni sūte
    traiguṇya-tad-viṣaya-veda-vitāyamānā
    sattvāvalambi-parasattva-viśuddha-sattvaṁ
    govindam ādi puruṣaṁ tam ahaṁ bhajāmi

### Translation

    I worship that primeval Lord Govinda,
        the all-good, transcendental pure existence;
    whose inferior potency is Māyā, of the trimodal nature
        of sattva, rajaḥ and tamoguṇa—the propagator
    of that Vedic wisdom which pertains to the world.

### Purport

Creation pertains to rajo-guṇa; following that is sustenance, which pertains to sattva-guṇa; and dissolution pertains to tamo-guṇa. Sattva that is a mixture of the three guṇas is mundane, whereas the sattva that is unmixed with rajaḥ- and tamo-guṇa is supramundane and the transcendental truth of eternal existence. He whose form abides in that existence—He is viśuddha-sattva, the pure truth which is devoid of Māyā's influence, transcendental to the material world and devoid of the mundane qualities or guṇas; He is spiritual joy personified. Māyā is the agent who has propagated the all-regulative Vedic knowledge that pertains to the three guṇas (*traiguṇya-viṣayaka-veda*).
