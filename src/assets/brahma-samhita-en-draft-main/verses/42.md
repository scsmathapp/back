## Verse 42

    ānanda-chinmaya-rasātmatayā manaḥsu
    yaḥ prāṇināṁ pratiphalan smaratām upetya
    līlāyitena bhuvanāni jayaty ajasraṁ
    govindam ādi puruṣaṁ tam ahaṁ bhajāmi

### Translation

    He whose divine ecstatic form
        is reflected in the minds of those who remember Him,
    as He perpetually conquers the world in His Play—
        that primeval Lord Govinda do I adore. 

### Purport

'Those who remember Him' refers to persons who, having heard the advices of the true devotees or sādhus, recollect the Name, Form, Quality and Pastimes of that Eternal Lord of Love, the Cupid of cupids. Playful Kṛṣṇa and His abode appears in their hearts. Whatever opulence and sweetness may be found in this world is summarily conquered by that revelation of the Pastimes in the holy abode.
