## Verse 47

    yaḥ kāraṇārṇava-jale bhajati sma yoga-
    nidrām ananta-jagad-aṇḍa-saroma-kūpaḥ
    ādhāra-śaktim avalambya parāṁ svamūrtiṁ
    govindam ādi puruṣaṁ tam ahaṁ bhajami

### Translation

    With infinite universes in the pores of His body,
        He assumes His supreme figure called Śeṣa,
    the reservoir of almighty power personified;
        He who reclines on the causal ocean,
    enjoying His trance of divine sleep,
        that Primeval Lord, Govinda, do I worship.

### Purport

(Ananta, who takes the form of the couch of Mahā- Viṣṇu, is being described.) The infinite couch upon which Mahā-Viṣṇu reclines—that infinite is the Avatār who is by nature a servant of Kṛṣṇa; He is known as 'Śeṣa'.
