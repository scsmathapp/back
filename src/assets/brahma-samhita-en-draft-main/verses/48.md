## Verse 48

    yasyaika-niśvasita-kālam athāvalambya
    jīvanti loma-bilajā jagad-aṇḍa-nāthāḥ
    viṣṇur mahān sa iha yasya kalā-viśeṣo
    govindam ādi puruṣaṁ tam ahaṁ bhajāmi

### Translation

    The lifespans of Brahmā and the gods
        of the universes born from the pores
    of the divine body of Mahā-Viṣṇu
        last for only one exhalation of Mahā-Viṣṇu;
    And Mahā-Viṣṇu is the portion of a portion of
        that Primeval Lord, Govinda, who I do worship.

### Purport

The almighty majesty of the entity of Viṣṇu has been illustrated herein.
