## Verse 49

    bhāsvān yathāśma-śakaleṣu nijeṣu tejaḥ
    svīyaṁ kiyat prakaṭayaty api yad-vad-atra
    brahmā ya eṣa jagad-aṇḍa-vidhāna-kartā
    govindam ādi puruṣaṁ tam ahaṁ bhajāmi

### Translation

    As the sun, Sūrya, manifests some of his light
        in the gems named after him as Sūrya-kānta,
    similarly, He by whom Brahmā is empowered
        to create the entire material universe—
    the Primeval Lord Govinda, do I worship.

### Purport

Generally there are two types of Brahmās. In certain millennia, when there is a qualified jīva present in the world, the potency of the Lord enters that jīva who then takes the post and executes the universal creative duties of Brahmā. For those millennia in which such an eligible jīva is not available, upon the liberation of the Brahmā of the previous millennium Kṛṣṇa delegates His own potency to create the rajo-guṇ-avatār of Brahmā. In actuality, Brahmā is superior to a general jīva, yet he is not directly the divinity; and the divinity is present to a greater degree within Śambhu, who has been described previously.

The underlying purport is that the fifty qualities of the general jīva are present in Brahmā in a fuller measure than in the jīva, plus he possesses to a fractional degree five more qualities not found in the jīvas. But those fifty qualities and the fractional five qualities are found in still greater proportions in Śambhu.
