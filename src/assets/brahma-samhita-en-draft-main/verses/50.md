## Verse 50

    yat-pāda-pallava-yugaṁ vinidhāya kumbha-
    dvandve praṇāma-samaye sa gaṇādhirājaḥ
    vighnān vihantum alamasya jagat-trayasya
    govindam ādi puruṣaṁ tam ahaṁ bhajāmi

### Translation

    For the power to crush the obstacles of the three worlds,
        He whose Lotus Feet Gaṇeśa perpetually holds
    upon the pair of nodes of his elephantine head—
        the Primeval Lord, Govinda, do I worship.

### Purport

Gaṇeśa holds the power to destroy all obstacles, and he is worshippable by the appropriate persons accordingly. As the worshippable Brahman with attributes, his qualification has afforded him a position amongst the five principal gods. Gaṇeśa holds the office of a god of delegated power. All his glory is granted by the grace of Govinda.
