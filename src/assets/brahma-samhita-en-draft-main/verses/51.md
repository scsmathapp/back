## Verse 51

    agnir-mahī-gaganam-ambu-marud-diśaś cha
    kālas tathātma-manasīti jagat-trayāṇi
    yasmād bhavanti vibhavanu viśanti yañ cha
    govindam ādi puruṣaṁ tam ahaṁ bhajāmi

### Translation

    Fire, earth, sky, water, air, space, time, soul, mind—
        the three worlds are created of these nine elements;
    He from whom these elements are born, in whom they
        remain, and in whom they enter in the end—
    that Primeval Lord, Govinda, do I worship.

### Purport

There is nothing more in the three worlds beyond the five elements, the directions (of space), time, the jīva and the mental element of mind, intelligence and ego that composes the subtle body of the conditioned soul. The karmīs or elevationists offer oblations for sacrifice into fire; mundaners know nothing beyond this world of directly perceivable nine elements. Regarding the self-delight (state of ātmārāma) sought after by the jñānīs or dry liberationists, the jīva himself is that joyful self. What is considered in Sāṅkhya philosophy to be prakṛti (nature) and ātmā (soul) are included in the above elements.

The purport is that every element delineated by all types of philosophers are included within these nine basic elements; and Śrī Govinda is the repository of creation, sustenance and dissolution of all these elements.
