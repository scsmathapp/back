## Verse 52

    yach chakṣur eṣa savitā sakala-grahāṇāṁ
    rājā samasta-sura-mūrtir-aśeṣa-tejāḥ
    yasyājñayā bhramati saṁbhṛta-kāla-chakro
    govindam ādi puruṣaṁ tam ahaṁ bhajāmi

### Translation

    With unlimited brilliance and power,
        the sun is the king of all the planets,
    the resort of all the gods—
        the personified eye of the universe.
    He upon whose order the sun,
        mounting the wheel of time,
    runs his perpetual orbit—
        that Primeval Lord, Govinda, do I worship. 

### Purport

There are many followers of Vedic religiosity that worship the sun as Brahman; the sun-god Sūrya is one of the hierarchy of the five principal gods.[^1] There are also many that profess heat to be the cause of the world, and therefore designate the sun, as the sole source of heat, to be the root cause of the world. Anyway, Sūrya is the presiding deity of the aggregate worldly heat, light and power for one sphere, and thus a god of delegated power. On the order of the Supreme Lord Govinda, the sun obediently executes his delegated service.

[^1]: Five principal gods, or pañcha-devatā: Sūrya, Gaṇeśa, Śakti, Śiva and Viṣṇu. This fivefold worship (pañchopāsanā) is professed by worshippers whose devotion is motivated by liberation. It is not admitted in the school of pure Vaiṣṇavism where Viṣṇu or Kṛṣṇa (Govinda) is known to be the Supreme Lord. Vide pages vii, 155. Vide *Jaiva-dharma* Chapter 4.
