## Verse 57

    athovācha mahāviṣṇur bhagavantaṁ prajāpatiṁ
    brahman mahattva-vijñāne prajāsarge cha chen matiḥ
    pañcha-ślokīm imāṁ vidyāṁ vatsa dattāṁ nibodha me

### Translation

Upon hearing these quintessential hymns of Brahmā, the Supreme Lord Kṛṣṇa said unto him, "O Brahman, if with knowledge of transcendental science you wish to create progeny, then, My dear one, hear the wisdom of these five ślokas from Me."

### Purport

The Names 'Kṛṣṇa' and 'Govinda' express the Form, Qualities and Pastimes of the Lord, and when Brahmā earnestly chanted those Names, the Lord was propitiated. The desire for creation was in Brahmā's heart. Kṛṣṇa then explained to Brahmā how transcendental exclusive devotion can be accomplished by a soul engaged in worldly occupations by combining his worldly activity with the desire to follow the order of the Lord:

"The transcendental science is knowledge of the supreme divinity. If with such knowledge you wish to create progeny, hear the teachings of bhakti that I shall impart to you in the next five ślokas." (That is, how to practise bhakti by executing worldly duties in the form of following the Lord's order.)
