## Verse 58

    prabuddhe jñāna-bhaktibhyām ātmany ānanda-chinmayī
    udety anuttamā bhaktir bhagavat-prema-lakṣaṇā

### Translation

When transcendental experience awakens by means of knowledge and devotion, the highest devotion symptomized by love for the Supreme Lord, Śrī Kṛṣṇa, the beloved of the soul, awakens in the devotee's heart.

### Purport

The meaning of actual 'knowledge' or jñāna is sambandha-jñāna—perspective of the correlation of the transcendental, the material, and Kṛṣṇa. Here, psychic, mental or intellectual knowledge or impersonal Brahman liberation is not indicated because such knowledge is opposed to devotion. Sambandha-jñāna or knowledge of the soul's relativity in the absolute constitutes the teachings of the first seven of the Ten Fundamental Divine Principles known as *Daśa-mūla*.

According to the scriptures that expound pure devotion, the principle of abhidheya or means to the end is the cultivation of divine service for Kṛṣṇa's transcendental pleasure by the practices of hearing, chanting, remembering, serving the Lotus Feet of the Lord, worshipping, praying, servitude, friendship and self-surrender. This is elaborately described in the holy book *Śrī Bhakti-rasāmṛta-sindhuḥ*.

By such knowledge and devotion, devotion in love divine is awakened and blooms in the heart of the devotee. This is the ultimate in devotion, and the objective of all spiritual endeavour for the jīva (prayojana).
