## Verse 60

    yasyāḥ śreyaskaraṁ nāsti yayā nirvṛtim āpnuyāt
    yā sādhayati mām eva bhaktiṁ tām eva sādhayet

### Translation

Sādhana-bhakti or practising devotional life is the means to the objective—prema-bhakti, devotion in love. Of all that is auspicious, there is absolutely nothing beyond prema-bhakti; She brings in Her retinue divine ecstatic joy, and She can give Me to My devotee.

### Purport

There is no greater good for the jīva beyond prema-bhakti. It is the objective of all devotional practices, and the ultimate transcendental ecstasy of the soul. It is only by virtue of prema-bhakti that one can attain the Lotus Feet of Kṛṣṇa. One who cultivates his practising devotional life with deep longing and earnestness for that objective will attain that treasure; others cannot.
